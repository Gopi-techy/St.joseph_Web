          <p>Mechanical Engineering is one of India’s most popular and sought-after fields. It is a field of engineering which involves the application of principles of physics, mathematics, and materials science for the design, development, manufacture, operation, and maintenance of machines, tools, engines, and other mechanical products.

            Mechanical engineering is an ever-evolving field with new technologies, concepts, and materials being developed daily. In India, the scope of mechanical engineering is vast, with opportunities ranging from production to design engineering, energy technology, automotive engineering, aeronautical engineering, biomedical engineering, and many more. There is immense scope for mechanical engineers in India, and it is expected to keep growing.</p>
