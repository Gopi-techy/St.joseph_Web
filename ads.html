          <p>Data science integrates diverse techniques, algorithms, and methods to derive insights and understanding from both structured and unstructured data. It's a field that spans multiple disciplines, leveraging statistical analysis, machine learning, data mining, and visualization techniques.Artificial Intelligence refers to the creation of machines that can imitate human intelligence, allowing them to carry out activities that usually necessitate human cognitive processes. These systems are engineered to replicate behaviors akin to humans, such as learning, solving problems, making decisions, and comprehending natural language</p>
