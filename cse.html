          <p>Computer Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.

            Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field.</p>

          <p>Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is one of the most sought-after courses in engineering. The field of CSE integrates computer engineering and computer science. The BE computer science colleges in Bangalore teach the basics of computer programming and networking and comprise a plethora of course content. They study programming languages, program design, computation, design and development of algorithms, computer software and hardware. Computer science engineers are involved in many aspects of computing, from the design of individual microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers to circuit designing and writing software that powers them.</p>
